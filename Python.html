  <h3 class="style3"> Python is an object-oriented, high-level programming language with integrated dynamic semantics primarily for web and app development. It is extremely attractive in the field of Rapid Application Development because it offers dynamic typing and dynamic binding options. 
Python is relatively simple, so it's easy to learn since it requires a unique syntax that focuses on readability. 
It is easier for developers to read and translate python code over other languages. As a result, this reduces the cost of maintenance of the program because it allows teams to work and collaborate without barriers such as experience and language.</h3>

					<strong>How is Python Used?</strong></div>
	</li>
  <h3 class="style3">Python is a general-purpose programming language, which is another way to say that it can be used for nearly everything. Most importantly, it is an interpreted language, which means that the written code is not actually translated to a computer-readable format at runtime. Whereas, most programming languages do this conversion before the program is even run. This type of language is also referred to as a "scripting language" because it was initially meant to be used for trivial projects. 
The concept of a "scripting language" has changed considerably since its inception, because Python is now used to write large, commercial style applications, instead of just banal ones. This reliance on Python has grown even more so as the internet gained popularity. A large majority of web applications and platforms rely on Python, including Google's search engine, YouTube, and the web-oriented transaction system of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). You know the language must be pretty serious when it's powering a stock exchange system.

					<span><strong>Benefits of Learning Python</li></strong></span></div>
  <h3 class="style3">Python language is extremely easy to learn as it’s considered to be the first step into other programming languages and frameworks. It’s very beneficial for beginners. Python can be used to develop prototypes, and quickly because it is so easy to work with and read.
1) Most automation, data mining, and big data platforms rely on Python. This is because it is the ideal language to work with for general purpose tasks.
2) Python allows for a more productive coding environment than massive languages like C# and Java. Experienced coders tend to stay more organized and productive when working with Python, as well.
3) Python is easy to read, even if you're not a skilled programmer. Anyone can begin working with the language, all it takes is a bit of patience and a lot of practice. 
4) It has a massive support base thanks to the fact that it is open source and community developed. Millions of like-minded developers work with the language on a daily basis and continue to improve core functionality. The latest version of Python continues to receive enhancements and updates as time progresses. This is a great way to network with other developer

					<strong>In what fields is python used?</strong></span> 
 	</div></li>
 <h3 class="style3">Python is widely used, including by a number of big companies like Google, Pinterest, Instagram, Disney, Yahoo!, Nokia, IBM, and many others. The Raspberry Pi - which is a mini computer and DIY lover's dream - relies on Python as its main programming language too. You're probably wondering why either of these things matter, and that's because once you learn Python, you'll never have a shortage of ways to utilize the skill. Not to mention, since a lot of big companies rely on the language, you can make good money as a Python developer.</h3>
