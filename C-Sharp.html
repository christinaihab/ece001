<h2 class="style2"><strong>What is C#?</strong></h2>

<h2 class="style3">C# is a general-purpose, modern and object-oriented programming language pronounced as “C Sharp”. It was developed by Microsoft led by Anders Hejlsberg and his team within the .NET initiative and was approved by the European Computer Manufacturers Association (ECMA) and International Standards Organization (ISO). C# is among the languages for Common Language Infrastructure. C# is a lot similar to Java syntactically and is easy for users who have knowledge of C, C++ or Java.
C# syntax simplifies many of the complexities of C++ and provides powerful features such as nullable types, enumerations, delegates, lambda expressions, and direct memory access. C# supports generic methods and types, which provide increased type safety and performance, and iterators, which enable implementers of collection classes to define custom iteration behaviours that are simple to use by client code. Language-Integrated Query (LINQ) expressions make the strongly typed query a first-class language construct.

	<h2 class="style2"><strong>History of C#?</strong></h2>
	<h2 class="style3">C# history started with the development of .NET Framework. Anders Hejlsberg and his team started to work on a programming language known as “Cool.” It stands for “C-like Object Oriented Language.” Later Microsoft decided to get rid of the name because of copyright issues at that point in time. With all the ASP.NET runtime libraries ported, it is renamed to C# (pronounced as see sharp).

Anders Hejlsberg, the principal designer of C#, aimed to fix the flaws in the popular programming languages such as Java, C++, Delphi, and other prominent programming languages. He cited that the flaws enabled him to work on Common Language Runtime(CLR). According to him, CLR is responsible for the C# language design.

James Gosling, the creator of Java, didn’t found C# any different from Java and said it is a copy of Java programming language with no distinct features. He also said that it is similar to Java with all the security, reliability and productivity removed.

Later on, C# added multiple features to facilitate functional programming. It also released LINQ extensions from C# 3.0 onwards. 3.0 also supported extension methods, Lambda expression and other key features that made it ready to be used as a functional programming.
