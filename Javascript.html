<p class="style2"><strong>What is Javascript?</strong></p>

<h2 class="style3"><span>JavaScript is a scripting or programming language that 
allows you to implement complex features on web pages — every time a web page 
does more than just sit there and display static information for you to look at 
— displaying timely content updates, interactive maps, animated 2D/3D 
graphics, scrolling video jukeboxes, etc. — you can bet that JavaScript is 
probably involved. It is the third layer of the layer cake of standard web 
technologies, two of which (HTML and CSS) we have covered in much more detail in 
other parts of the Learning Area. Compiled languages on the other hand are 
transformed (compiled) into another form before they are run by the computer. 
For example, C/C++ are compiled into assembly language that is then run by the 
computer. The program is executed from a binary format, which was generated from 
the original program source code. JavaScript is a lightweight interpreted 
programming language. The web browser receives the JavaScript code in its 
original text form and runs the script from that. From a technical standpoint, 
most modern JavaScript interpreters actually use a technique called just-in-time 
compiling to improve performance; the JavaScript source code gets compiled into 
a faster, binary format while the script is being used, so that it can be run as 
quickly as possible. However, JavaScript is still considered an interpreted 
language, since the compilation is handled at run time, rather than ahead of 
time.</span>
