<p class="style2"><strong>What is Java?</strong></p>
<p class="style3">Java is a general-purpose computer programming language that 
is concurrent, class-based, object-oriented, and specifically designed to have 
as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is intended to let 
application developers “write once, run anywhere” (WORA), meaning that 
compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need 
for recompilation. Java is a computer programming language. It enables 
programmers to write computer instructions using English-based commands instead 
of having to write in numeric codes. It’s known as a high-level language 
because it can be read and written easily by humans. Like English, Java has a 
set of rules that determine how the instructions are written. These rules are 
known as its syntax. Once a program has been written, the high-level 
instructions are translated into numeric codes that computers can understand and 
execute.

 <h2 class="style2">Benefits of Java</h2>
 <ol class="style5">
 
 <li><strong>	Ease of Use: </strong>The fundamentals of Java came from a 
	programming language called C++. Although C++ is a powerful language, it is 
	complex in its syntax and inadequate for some of Java's requirements. Java 
	built on and improved the ideas of C++ to provide a programming language 
	that was powerful and easy to use. </li><li><strong>	Reliability: </strong>
	Java needed to reduce the likelihood of fatal errors from programmer 
	mistakes. With this in mind, object-oriented programming was introduced. 
	When data and its manipulation were packaged together in one place, Java was 
	robust </li><li><strong>	Security: </strong>Because Java was originally 
	targeting mobile devices that would be exchanging data over networks, it was 
	built to include a high level of security. Java is probably the most secure 
	programming language to date. <li><strong>	Platform Independence: </strong>
	Programs need to work regardless of the machines they're being executed on. 
	Java was written to be a portable and cross-platform language that doesn't 
	care about the operating system, hardware, or devices that it's running on.</li>

<p class="style2"><strong>History of Java</strong></p>
<p class="style3">Java was started as a project called "Oak" by James Gosling in June 1991. Gosling's goals were to implement a virtual machine and a language that had a familiar C-like notation but with greater uniformity and simplicity than C/C++. The first public implementation was Java 1.0 in 1995. It made the promise of "Write Once, Run Anywhere", with free runtimes on popular platforms. It was fairly secure and its security was configurable, allowing for network and file access to be limited. The major web browsers soon incorporated it into their standard configurations in a secure "applet" configuration. popular quickly. New versions for large and small platforms (J2EE and J2ME) soon were designed with the advent of "Java 2". Sun has not announced any plans for a "Java 3".
In 1997, Sun approached the ISO/IEC JTC1 standards body and later the Ecma International to formalize Java, but it soon withdrew from the process. Java remains a proprietary de facto standard that is controlled through the Java Community Process. Sun makes most of its Java implementations available without charge, with revenue being generated by specialized products such as the Java Enterprise System. Sun distinguishes between its Software Development Kit (SDK) and Runtime Environment (JRE) which is a subset of the SDK, the primary distinction being that in the JRE the compiler is not present.
